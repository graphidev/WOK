Web Operational Kit (WOK)
=============

This project is a framework made to develop website or web tools easier. That's what we call a "Framework", you're right. 
But unlike to big and famous frameworks, this one only offer a quick base of developpement. 
The main idea is to have not to take care about compatibility nor where to place files. 
Everything is preconfigured structure and settings. For example, every string is treated as UTF-8.

Furthermore, this framework is structured to be easily updatable. without making trouble with your project.

-------------------
* An Apache Web server
* PHP 5.3 or higher configured on it
* URL Rewriting module activated
* A project idea


What did it contains ?

* An "Automatically-get-everything-you-need" class
* Some controller tools (really easy to use)
